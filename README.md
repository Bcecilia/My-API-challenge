# My-API-challenge

This API was created for a challenge.

## Requeriments

- You need a localhost to run this project, I used xampp (version 7.4.11). You can download it here:
https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html

- After the installation, you need to activate xampp. Open xampp's app and click "start" on Apache's module.

- Download the folder "My-API-Challenge" then copy and paste it on your PC: C:\xampp\htdocs\

## How to run

- Open any browser (I recommend Chrome) and post the next URL: http://localhost/My-API-challenge/index.php?

## Endpoints

I made three endpoints, all of them are GETs and I added an UI to make it easier.

### Hello World

- Click submit to receive a "Hello world!" on the first button.

### Pokemon's information

- Write a pokemon's name to receive its information, the request will return a JSON form a pokemon's API. For example, you can use: pikachu, ditto, psyduck, charmander or gyarados, and then, click "submit".

### Pokemon's evolution

- Get the evolutions' names by their pokemon id, the request will return a JSON. Write a pokemon's id to receive its evolutions, you can use:
2, 10, 23, 46, and then, click "submit".
